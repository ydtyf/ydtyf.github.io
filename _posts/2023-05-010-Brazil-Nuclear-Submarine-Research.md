# History and current progress

The history and current state of nuclear submarine development by the Brazilian Navy can be explored through two distinct articles[^1]. This brief overview will primarily focus on developments since the revitalization of the nuclear submarine program in 2008.

Brazil's nuclear submarine research encompasses two main components. The first involves the complete process technology for producing enriched uranium fuel, which falls under the Navy's nuclear program (PNM), and includes uranium enrichment and nuclear reactor manufacturing. The second component pertains to the manufacturing of conventional and nuclear submarines as part of the submarine development program (PROSUB).

Figure 2 Brazil's program on nuclear submarine research and its counterpart 
In terms of uranium enrichment, Brazil's PNM program has been successful (the following naval nuclear program mainly refers to reactor research and development). In 1975, Brazil signed an agreement with Germany to supply nuclear fuel to a nuclear power plant built by Westinghouse in Brazil. Due to the objections of the Netherlands in Urenco, Germany only transferred to Brazil the jet nozzle enrichment technology which was not bound by the Urenco agreement. After finding that it was impractical, the Brazilian Navy launched the local centrifuge program, partly referring to the Soviet gas centrifuge program announced by the United States, which succeeded in 1985 and reached a concentration of 20% in 1988. It is estimated that Brazil's (in 2016) uranium enrichment capacity is 0.02 million SWU, which can produce 500 kg of 20% enriched uranium, equivalent to producing highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon in about one month, or fueling several nuclear submarines in one year .

The Brazilian Navy has had the idea of pursuing nuclear submarines since at least 1954. Around 1980, the then President Geisel approved the nuclear propulsion submarine program, and then the Brazilian Navy reached an agreement with the Brazilian Institute of Nuclear Energy and Energy (IPEN) to develop nuclear propulsion technology. The program was divided into nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear propulsion, and was transferred to the Naval Aramar Center after 1985. Throughout the 1980s, the funding were sufficient and the project progressed rapidly, completing the uranium enrichment research mentioned above. But then the fund declined and the government lacked the willingness to continue the implementation. The Brazilian Navy could only invest the minimum amount of money to ensure the continuation of the project.

In 2007, then-Brazilian President Lula decided to support the program again after visiting the Aramar Center, and institutionalized it by including it in the National Defense Strategy in 2008. Labgene, which studies submarine reactors, has been able to move ahead with the project thanks to government funding. 

Brazil's current nuclear submarine program is a two-step process. Brazil and France signed a $7.6 billion cooperation agreement in 2008 . France transferred to it the technology to build the Scorpène-class submarine, but did not participate in the design of the nuclear part . According to the treaty, Brazil will first build four S-BR conventional submarines, and then build an SN-BR nuclear-powered submarine. At present, two conventional submarines (S-40, S-41) have been built and launched for testing, one (S-42) is nearly finished, and one (S-43) is under construction . The first conventional submarine S-40 will be handed to the Brazilian Navy . The research and development of Brazil's nuclear submarine has encountered many difficulties, which has led to delays in its launch time. Initially, Brazil expected to complete it in 2023 and enter service in 2025 . The latest plan is to launch in 2029 and enter service in 2034 .

The parameters of conventional submarines and nuclear submarines are as follows:
Table 1 Comparison of Brazilian Scorpene-class nuclear submarines with conventional submarines
	S-BR 	SN-BR 
Size	75m Long, 6.2m in Diameter	100m Long, 9.8m in Diameter

The world is most concerned about the uranium enrichment parameters used in nuclear submarine fuel. The results shown by different sources vary widely. The director of the Sao Paulo Naval Technology Center in Brazil declared that the uranium concentration will be lower than 5% . The chairman of the Brazilian Navy’s nuclear power development program stated in 2014 that the concentration was 6%-8%. Another estimate is that 18-19% concentration of nuclear fuel may be used . For  details on some parameters of nuclear submarines, please refer to Brazil’s Nuclear Submarine: A Broader Approach to the Safeguards Issue published in the Brazilian journal.

A reference is IPEN/MB-01, a zero-power reactor used to verify some key technologies of the naval nuclear reactor onshore prototype reactor , and its uranium concentration is 4.3486% . French nuclear submarines, on the other hand, use low-enriched uranium, which may have influenced Brazilian designs .

A series of companies were formed during the program, as follows:

The ICN company: Itaguai Naval Constructions (Itaguaí Construções Navais), established in 2009, has obtained the submarine technology transferred from France and is responsible for the construction of the main parts of all conventional and nuclear submarines. The company, based in Itaguai, Brazil, is 59 percent owned by the Brazilian government and 41 percent by France, where many Brazilian employees are trained.

Amazônia Azul Tecnologias de Defesa S.A. (Blue Amazon Technology Defense Company) was established in 2013 to support the Navy's nuclear and submarine development programs and to promote the wider use of related technologies in Brazil.

For more information on the Brazilian public and private companies involved, refer to Defense Weekly's article .

In the future, Brazil plans to build 15 conventional submarines and 6 nuclear submarines.
 
Difficulties Encountered by Brazilians and Countermeasures
In a word, there are two main difficulties faced by Brazil: insufficient funds and insufficient technical capacity.
 
Figure 3 Brazil's GDP data from 2007 to 2020 
It can be seen from Figure 3 that the Brazilian economy has declined sharply after 2014, which has affected the budget for submarine research and development. In addition, the submarine program is also plagued by corruption. In the Odebrech corruption case that once caused a shock in Latin America, the shipyard used for the submarine program and the Itaguaí naval base construction project were affected. Recently, the Brazilian Navy believes that the budget allocated to the submarine program and the naval nuclear program in 2021 is less than the current project promotion contract amount. In fiscal year 2021, the naval submarine program will be reduced by 31%, and the naval nuclear program will be reduced by 49%. Programs will be significantly affected (the Brazilian Navy claims that these programs are at a critical juncture), which may cause delays in the nuclear submarine program. Brazil's defense minister announced that an additional 267.5 million reinals (about $48 million) would be needed for the two programs.

Lack of funds can lead to downtime on contract projects, idle equipment and layoffs, and additional material storage costs .

According to a report on October 30, 2021, Admiral Olsen, Director General of the Department of Nuclear and Technology Development of the Brazilian Navy, said that the epidemic and insufficient financial budget may affect important contracts to be signed with France next year .

In fact, Brazil's nuclear program suffered setbacks many times, resulting in the loss of a large number of relevant talents, which hindered the development of its nuclear program . In 1991, the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN) had 3,750 practitioners, but now (around 2013) there are only 2,550, and the average age is 56 years old .

On the technical level, it is said that Brazil is still inconclusive on the issue of nuclear fuel enrichment, and welding technology is also lacking.  In addition, Brazil pursues the greatest degree of localization, but progress has been frustrated. The report on October 30 also showed that when building the onshore prototype reactor, some equipment could not be produced in Brazil and could only be purchased from foreign countries. It is not clear how this will affect the construction of the prototype reactor, and what countries Brazil can purchase from .

In addition, in 2016, the Scorpène-class submarines purchased by India had a large-scale leak. It is uncertain how this will affect the Brazilian-made Scorpène-class submarines .
 
foreign support
According to publicly available sources, France is said to have helped in the design of nuclear submarine reactors, but it was not possible to verify this or to what extent . Brazil originally planned to build the reactor independently, but judging from the news on October 30, there may be information that Brazil seeks support for nuclear-related parts in the near future.

As for the non-nuclear part, France undoubtedly gave great support. According to the contract, the technology of the entire Scorpene-class submarine was transferred to Brazil, and a large number of Brazilian engineers, builders and soldiers were trained .

In addition, a French company also supported the propulsion device (Jeumont Electric) ; an Austrian company (Bilfinger Maschinenbau) provided the reactor auxiliary component voltage regulator; Rolls-Royce provided the safety instrument and control system, etc.

In the early years, Brazil received some support from Germany in its uranium enrichment project. However, considering that Brazil's uranium enrichment technology is mature, it will not be discussed here.
 
How to solve safeguard supervision issues between Brazil and IAEA
The current status of signing treaties related to safeguard supervision in Brazil is as follows:
Table 2 Brazil's signing of treaties related to safeguards
Treaty	Status
INFCIRC/153	Signed and Ratified
INFCIRC/435	Signed and Ratified
INFCIRC/540	Not Sign
TPNW	Signed but not Ratified

Other nuclear-related treaties to which Brazil is a party can be found in the IAEA .

As of now, all uranium enrichment projects in Brazil are guaranteed by ABACC, and Brazil is even the only country that allows inspection of military nuclear facilities . Judging from the current information, Brazil may be negotiating with the IAEA whether to accept AP, but a document claims that Brazilian officials believe that the safeguard supervision of nuclear submarines should be consistent with the quadrilateral agreement .

Regarding fuel regulation for nuclear submarines, the Quad actually goes a step further than the CSA. Article 14 of the CSA allows the parties concerned to use nuclear materials in non-prohibited military activities after notifying the IAEA, and to place the nuclear materials back under the IAEA's safeguards after the completion of this process ; Requires that special procedures be initiated if nuclear material is used for nuclear propulsion (including nuclear submarines and prototype reactors) . In contrast, although the quadripartite agreement does not specify the content of special procedures, at least the regulatory requirements are preserved, and the CSA completely waives the right to safeguard when nuclear fuel is used for submarine operation.

As of now, Brazil and the IAEA are still negotiating, and there is no result of the negotiations on how to implement the special procedures. If regulatory safeguards are ultimately based on a quadripartite agreement, it is likely that the IAEA and ABACC will jointly provide safeguards.

The introduction of the specific support plan should be much earlier than the launch of the nuclear submarine - because the prototype reactor of the land reactor also needs to be verified, and it (2131-R, with an estimated power of 48MW) is under construction in the Labgene laboratory of the Aramar Center, and has been carried out The turbine generator (Block30) is being tested , and the reactor itself is being built in the laboratory  (it belongs to the module Block40, the reactor code is 2131-R, and the reactor components are manufactured by NUCLEP in Brazil), but according to the report on October 30, there are some difficulties in the reactor part.

Figure 2 is the structure of the power part of the Brazilian nuclear submarine, where Block 40 is the reactor, Block 30 is the generator set, Block 20 is the motor, and Block 10 is the propeller.
 
Figure 4 Brazilian nuclear submarine power part structure
Some sources claim that Brazil built a land-based prototype reactor (RENAP, with a planned power of 11MW) before 2008 . According to my research, it should not have been built. The more authoritative literature  only mentions that the reactor pressure vessel has been built. Although it has not been built, there is news (NTI) that the 11MW prototype reactor and the 48MW prototype reactor are in a progressive relationship in the project, and I cannot verify the accuracy of this information. What's more, there is currently no record of onshore prototype reactors in the IAEA's database. It is the experimental zero-power reactor (IPEN/MB-01) that has been truly built and accepted by the IAEA. RENAP should be only a concept in the end.

However, judging from the literature , there is another possibility that 11MW and 48MW refer to the same reactor, representing electrical power 11MWe and thermal power 48MWth respectively (part of the thermal power generates water vapor to drive the propeller. See Figure 1). It is impossible to verify whether the 11MW is a coincidence or indeed the same pile.
  
Figure 5 2131-R appearance and structure 
In July 2021, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi visited the LABGENE laboratory and visited the construction of Block40. I think this may indicate that the security negotiations between Brazil and the IAEA have achieved some results .

It is worth noting that the onshore prototype reactor 2131-R should be distinguished from RMB (Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor). Although the two are close to each other in the town of Ipero, Brazil, the two reactors are completely different. The latter has a power of only 30MW and uses 19.75% enriched fuel. Wikipedia conflates it, which is wrong.

Some views on how IAEA conducts safeguards agreements
Although it is uncertain what kind of security agreement Brazil and the IAEA will eventually reach, researchers in Brazil and abroad have given some opinions.

Matias Spektor believes that the specific negotiation process and results will be affected by the following aspects: Brazil will use the difference between ABACC and CSA as a bargaining chip, and will also link the intensity of verification with the intensity of nuclear disarmament by nuclear-weapon states; on the other hand, due to Due to the impact of corruption and other incidents on the project, Brazil began to consider whether to accept AP, and Argentina, which is also a partner of ABACC, may ask Brazil to consider accepting AP. In the end, this will be the big test for ABACC .

Frank von Hippel pointed out the academic community's suggestion on how to stack Brazilian nuclear submarines for security :
1.	Enriched uranium will remain under IAEA safeguards until it is used for fuel production;
2.	If the fuel design is deemed sensitive, IAEA inspectors will use Containment and Surveillance Techniques to verify that no nuclear material has left the fabrication or storage facility without the IAEA's knowledge. Inspectors will check these facilities for undeclared enriched uranium residues after production activities have concluded;
3.	Before the fuel is loaded into the submarine reactor, inspectors will monitor the fuel from outside a special container, which can hide the details of the fuel design;
4.	After the fueling of the submarine is completed, the inspector will seal the pressure vessel with the core and the filling port so that the next inspection can determine whether they have been opened between inspections;
5.	When the spent fuel is removed from the reactor, inspectors place it under safety measures on site and, if necessary, seal the spent fuel in containers;
6.	Ultimately, spent fuel will be stored in IAEA-protected repositories or reprocessed. If it is post-processed, the process needs to be quarantined and monitored. Until after the fuel has been processed, conventional IAEA safeguards are re-imposed on the recovered uranium and plutonium.

Jeffrey Kaplow  proposed several options to reduce the likelihood of using the Navy's nuclear submarine nuclear fuel exemption policy to develop nuclear weapons:
1.	Promote the IAEA's development of safeguards for naval nuclear power reactors, requiring future nuclear submarine transfer technology to limit the level of uranium enrichment (the Pakistan-French agreement does not limit this);
2.	Completely prohibit the transfer of nuclear submarines, increase the difficulty of research and development in non-nuclear countries, and relatively increase the cost performance of conventional submarines;
3.	Promote all countries (mainly the United States and Britain) to use low-enriched uranium as submarine fuel;
4.	Push for a new treaty to close NPT's loophole on naval nuclear power reactors, such as considering negotiating an cut-off treaty.

Andrea de Sá pointed out the reasons for Brazil's refusal of AP. The main concern is that this will lead to on-site inspections of military institutions that develop nuclear submarines; on the other hand, Brazil wants to protect the confidentiality of uranium enrichment and believes that inspectors may affect centrifuges and other equipment. All companies in the production chain, even if they have nothing to do with the nuclear industry themselves (such as a car company that produces centrifuge parts). On the other hand, people familiar with the matter interviewed by the author (the article was written in 2015) said that Brazil considered applying for an exemption only when the nuclear fuel was on board, and allowing inspectors to inspect the reactor while fuel was being loaded and unloaded. In addition, it may even be possible to allow the IAEA to inspect feed seals during routine maintenance. The author believes that under the premise of respecting military secrets, Brazilian officials do not resist verification.

Andrea de Sá suggested that the role of ABACC could be strengthened, given more responsibility for safety and security, and some means could be adopted: prohibiting reprocessing, requiring the concentration of uranium to be below 20%, strengthening the training of inspectors, increasing the use of environmental sampling, agreed AP et al .

Eugenio Pacelli Lazzarotti Diniz Costa believes that a plan similar to that mentioned by Jeffrey Kaplow is feasible, and believes that a specific plan can be proposed at ABACC to enhance the international community's confidence in Brazil's nuclear submarine project. In addition, Brazil has to consider a series of issues from the export of nuclear submarines to accepting APs in the future, and make plans as soon as possible. Otherwise, as the launching of nuclear submarines approaches, Brazil will be under increasing international pressure. Bad for Brazil. The author believes that in terms of AP, Brazil and Argentina can negotiate a special AP with the IAEA to enhance the participation of ABACC on this issue .

Finally, Sébastien Philippe gave a technical solution in Safeguarding the Military Naval Nuclear Fuel Cycle.
